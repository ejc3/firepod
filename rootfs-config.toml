# fcvm Configuration
#
# This file configures both runtime paths and rootfs setup.
# The rootfs SHA is computed from [base], [kernel], [packages], [services], etc.
# The [paths] section does NOT affect rootfs SHA.

[paths]
# Directory for mutable VM data (vm-disks, state, snapshots)
# Override per inception level (e.g., /mnt/fcvm-btrfs/level-1)
data_dir = "/mnt/fcvm-btrfs"

# Directory for shared content-addressed assets (kernels, rootfs, initrd, image-cache)
# All inception levels share this for deduplication via btrfs reflinks
assets_dir = "/mnt/fcvm-btrfs"

# Rootfs Modification Plan
#
# The SHA256 of the generated setup script determines the image name: layer2-{sha}.raw
# If base, kernel, packages, services, files, fstab, or cleanup change, Layer 2 is rebuilt.
#
# fc-agent is NOT in Layer 2 at all (neither binary nor service).
# Both are injected per-VM at boot time via initrd.
# This allows updating fc-agent without rebuilding Layer 2.
