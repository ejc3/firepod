Subject: [PATCH] KVM: arm64: Add cache synchronization for nested guest exit

From: fcvm <fcvm@localhost>

Under nested virtualization with NV2, when an L2 guest writes to memory
and then exits to L1, the L1 hypervisor's userspace may not see the
writes due to stale cache entries from the double Stage 2 translation.

This manifests as data corruption in vsock packet handling where L2
writes data to virtqueue buffers, but L1's Firecracker reads zeros
or stale data when processing the packets.

The issue occurs because:
1. L2 writes go through shadow S2 translation (L2 GPA -> L1 IPA -> PA)
2. L1 userspace reads go through a different cache pathway
3. No barrier ensures L2's writes are visible to L1's reads

Add a DSB (Data Synchronization Barrier) in kvm_nested_sync_hwstate()
to ensure all data writes from the nested guest are completed and
visible before returning to the L1 hypervisor.

Also add cache maintenance in the nested S2 fault handler to ensure
page table walks see consistent data.
